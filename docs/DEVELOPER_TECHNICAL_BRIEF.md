## 1. One-sentence pitch (memorize this)

**ZizkaDB is the operational database for AI agents** — it logs what agents do, links decisions by cause, searches history by meaning, replays past state, and tells you when an agent’s behavior has drifted from its own baseline.

---

## 2. What ZizkaDB is — and is not

| ZizkaDB **is** | ZizkaDB **is not** |
|----------------|-------------------|
| An **event store + memory layer** for agents | A vector DB you query only by embedding similarity |
| **Framework-agnostic** (Claude, OpenAI, LangChain, custom code) | Locked to one LLM vendor or one orchestration framework |
| **Causal** (parent → child event links) | A chat transcript dump |
| **Self-hostable** (Docker, full features, free) | SaaS-only |
| **Model-agnostic** for logging; embeddings use OpenAI for semantic search | A replacement for your LLM |

**Analogy for developers:** “Think Postgres for agent *decisions*, plus lineage, semantic recall, and drift detection — not another Pinecone index.”

---

## 3. The problem we solve

When you ship agents to production, teams hit the same walls:

1. **“Why did it do that?”** — Tool calls and replies are disconnected; you cannot walk backward from a bad output to the input that caused it.
2. **“What did it know at the time?”** — Chat logs are not reconstructible agent *state* at a timestamp.
3. **“Is this agent broken or just different?”** — Prompt changes, model upgrades, and tool additions change behavior silently.
4. **“Our memory is a black box”** — Vendor memory (Claude/OpenAI) does not live in *your* codebase, audit trail, or GDPR erasure story.

ZizkaDB is built for **production debugging, compliance, and cross-session memory you control**.

---

## 4. Core capabilities (what to say to engineers)

### 4.1 Event logging

Everything is an **event**: `agent` name, `event` type string, JSON `data` payload, timestamp.

```python
result = await db.log(
    agent="support-bot",
    event="tool_call",
    data={"tool": "get_billing", "user_id": 123},
)
# result.event_id — use for causal links and why()
```

Optional: `session_id` (groups a conversation/run), `metadata` (tenant-defined tags).

### 4.2 Causal lineage

Pass `parent_id` (Python) / `parentId` (TypeScript) to say *this event happened because of that one*.

```python
msg  = await db.log(agent="bot", event="user_message", data={...})
tool = await db.log(agent="bot", event="tool_call", data={...}, parent_id=msg.event_id)
chain = await db.why(tool.event_id)
chain.print()  # walks the tree to the root
```

**API:** `GET /v1/events/{event_id}/why`

### 4.3 Semantic search

Events are embedded automatically (**OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`**). Search in natural language across an agent’s history.

```python
results = await db.search("customer angry about billing", agent="support-bot", limit=10)
```

**API:** `POST /v1/search`

### 4.4 Time travel

Reconstruct agent state at any past timestamp from logged events. Each event has a **SHA-256 checksum** over payload content.

```python
state = await db.at("support-bot", datetime(2026, 5, 1, 15, 0))
```

**API:** `GET /v1/events/at`

### 4.5 Context injection (memory for prompts)

Drop-in style memory for system prompts: recent events + semantically relevant past events, trimmed to a token budget.

```python
context = await db.context_for(agent="support-bot", task="user asking about billing", max_tokens=2000)
```

**API:** `POST /v1/memory/context`

### 4.6 Behavioral baseline & drift

After enough sessions (with `session_id` on logs), ZizkaDB compares **recent** behavior vs **historical baseline**:

- Event-type distribution
- Parent→child transition patterns
- Session length, error rate

Returns a **drift score** (0 = identical, 1 = totally different) and verdict: `stable`, `minor_drift`, `noticeable_drift`, `significant_drift`.

```python
baseline = await db.baseline(agent="support-bot", recent_window=50)
```

**API:** `GET /v1/agents/{agent_id}/baseline`

**Honest caveat:** Needs real session volume; early on status is `warming_up` or `insufficient_data`. This is statistical behavior comparison, not “the model hallucinated” detection.

### 4.7 Session diff & GDPR forget

- **`memory_diff(session_id)`** — what changed in a session (API: `GET /v1/memory/diff/{session_id}`).
- **`forget(filter_key, filter_value)`** — delete all events matching metadata (e.g. `user_id`, `email`) for GDPR erasure (API: `DELETE /v1/memory/forget`).

### 4.8 Audit trail

Events are **append-only** with per-event checksums. Position as tamper-evident operational history (export story is on roadmap/marketing — verify with engineering before promising signed legal exports).

## 5. How developers integrate (four paths — same backend)

| Path | Install | Best for |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Python SDK** | `pip install zizkadb-sdk` | FastAPI agents, notebooks, batch jobs |
| **TypeScript SDK** | `npm install zizkadb-sdk` | Node, Bun, Deno, edge workers |
| **MCP server** | `uvx zizkadb-mcp` | Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf — **no app code changes** |
| **REST API** | `curl` / any HTTP client | Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, mobile |

**Cloud (managed):**

```python
from zizkadb import ZizkaDB
db = ZizkaDB("zizkadb_live_xxxx")  # API key from dashboard Settings
```

**Self-hosted:**

```python
db = ZizkaDB(host="http://localhost:8000")  # or DEV_API_KEY for local dev
```

**Default cloud host in SDKs:** `https://db.zizka.ai`

---

## 6. MCP — the “zero code” pitch for Cursor/Claude users

**MCP** = Model Context Protocol. ZizkaDB ships an MCP server so the IDE/assistant can call tools directly.

**Config example (Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or Claude Desktop):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zizkadb": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["zizkadb-mcp"],
      "env": { "ZIZKADB_API_KEY": "zizkadb_live_xxxx" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Self-hosted MCP:** set `ZIZKADB_HOST` to your API URL.

| MCP tool | What it does |
|----------|----------------|
| `log_event` | Log action with optional causal parent |
| `search_memory` | Semantic search over history |
| `get_context` | Prompt-ready memory block |
| `why` | Causal chain for an event |
| `query_events` | List/filter recent events |
| `time_travel` | State at a timestamp |
| `memory_diff` | Session summary |
| `forget` | GDPR delete by filter |

**MCP license:** MIT (SDK/core stack: AGPL-3.0 — see §12).

---

## 7. REST API map (for “show me the HTTP” questions)

Base URL: `https://db.zizka.ai` (self-host: your host, port **8000**).

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

- Production API keys: prefix **`zizkadb_live_`**
- Dashboard login uses JWT (OTP email)
- Self-host dev: optional `DEV_API_KEY` in `.env` (never in production)

| Area | Method | Path | Purpose |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| Events | POST | `/v1/events` | Log event |
| Events | GET | `/v1/events` | Query events |
| Events | GET | `/v1/events/{id}/why` | Causal chain |
| Events | GET | `/v1/events/at` | Time travel |
| Search | POST | `/v1/search` | Semantic search |
| Memory | POST | `/v1/memory/context` | Context block |
| Memory | GET | `/v1/memory/diff/{session_id}` | Session diff |
| Memory | DELETE | `/v1/memory/forget` | GDPR erase |
| Agents | GET | `/v1/agents` | List agents |
| Agents | GET | `/v1/agents/{id}/baseline` | Drift / baseline |
| Agents | GET | `/v1/agents/{id}/sessions` | Sessions |
| Auth | POST | `/v1/auth/request-otp` | Email OTP |
| Auth | POST | `/v1/auth/verify-otp` | Get JWT |
| Auth | POST | `/v1/auth/api-keys` | Create API key (dashboard JWT only; plan-limited) |
| Health | GET | `/health` | Status check |
| Stats | GET | `/v1/stats` | Public install counters (homepage) |

Interactive docs: **https://db.zizka.ai/swagger** (FastAPI OpenAPI).

## 8. SDK method cheat sheet

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `log(...)` | Write event |
| `why(event_id)` | Causal chain |
| `search(query, ...)` | Semantic search |
| `at(agent, timestamp)` | Time travel |
| `query(agent, ...)` | List events |
| `context_for(agent, task, max_tokens?)` | Prompt memory |
| `baseline(agent, recent_window?)` | Drift detection |
| `memory_diff(session_id)` | Session summary |
| `forget(filter_key, filter_value)` | GDPR delete |
| `agents()` | List agents |

Python 3.10+, TypeScript works on Node/Deno/Bun/edge.

---

## 9. Architecture (for technical due diligence)

**Managed production (db.zizka.ai):**

- **Dashboard:** Next.js 14 (PM2 on port 3001 behind nginx)
- **API:** FastAPI (Python), Docker, port 8000
- **Postgres** + **pgvector** — events, tenants, embeddings
- **Qdrant** — vector search
- **Redis** — caching/sessions
- **Nginx** — TLS, routes `/` → frontend, `/v1/` → API

**Self-host (Docker Compose):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zizka-ai/ZizkaDB
cp .env.example infra/.env   # OPENAI_API_KEY required for embeddings
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Stack: postgres (pgvector), qdrant, redis, api. Dashboard optional (`npm run dev` in `dashboard/`).

**Embeddings:** Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, **logging still works**; semantic search and context injection that rely on embeddings will not.

**Telemetry:** SDK/MCP send **one anonymous ping** on startup (SDK name, version, OS, cloud vs self-host). No event payloads, no API keys. Opt out: `ZIZKADB_TELEMETRY=false`.

---

## 10. Authentication & onboarding flow

1. Sign up at **https://db.zizka.ai/signup** — email OTP, no password.
2. Dashboard → **Settings** → **Create API key** (`zizkadb_live_...`).
3. Paste key into SDK, MCP env, or `Authorization: Bearer` header.
4. Start logging from agent code or MCP.

**Multi-tenant:** API keys are scoped to a tenant/project; events are isolated per tenant.

---

## 11. Pricing (managed cloud)

| Plan | Price | Highlights |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Self-Hosted** | Free forever | Full feature set, your infra, Docker, community support |
| **Pro** | €39/mo | 100M events, 90-day retention, 3 projects, email support, **1-month free trial**, no credit card to start |
| **Team** | €99/mo | 1B events, 1-year retention, 10 seats, priority support, 1-month free trial |

**Line for developers:** “Free if you self-host; paid if you don’t want to run Postgres/Qdrant yourself.”

---

## 12. Licensing (do not hand-wave this)

| Component | License |
|-----------|---------|
| Core API + self-host stack | **AGPL-3.0** |
| Python SDK | **AGPL-3.0** |
| TypeScript SDK | **AGPL-3.0** (per package metadata) |
| MCP server | **MIT** |

**What to say:** “Open source, self-hostable. AGPL applies to the core platform and SDKs — if you modify and distribute the server, AGPL obligations apply. MCP is MIT for easy IDE integration. Legal review for commercial embedding is normal.”

**Do not say:** “Fully MIT” or “no license restrictions.”

---

## 13. Competitive positioning (facts-first)

Use the comparison on the homepage; verify competitors’ docs before live debates.

| Capability | LangSmith | Mem0 | Pinecone | **ZizkaDB** |
|------------|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Agent event logging | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Causal lineage | ~ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Time travel (state at T) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Semantic search on history | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Any framework/model | ~ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Behavioral baseline / drift | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Cross-agent fleet queries | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Per-event checksum on export | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Self-host free | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |

**~** = partial (e.g. LangSmith is strongest inside LangChain ecosystem).

**ZizkaDB wedge:** Vector DBs store embeddings; ZizkaDB stores **what happened, why, and what came next**, plus **drift vs the agent’s own past**.

---

## 14. FAQ — hard questions from developers

**Q: How is this different from LangSmith?**
A: LangSmith is excellent for LangChain-centric tracing and evals. ZizkaDB is a **standalone operational DB** with causal trees, time travel, cross-agent queries, and behavioral baselines — works with any stack.

**Q: How is this different from Mem0?**
A: Mem0 focuses on long-term memory retrieval for prompts. ZizkaDB adds **causal lineage, session replay, drift baselines, and audit-oriented event storage**.

**Q: Do we need to replace Pinecone?**
A: No. Pinecone is for RAG document search. ZizkaDB is for **agent decision history**. Many teams use both.

**Q: Does it wrap our LLM calls?**
A: No. You add `db.log()` (or MCP `log_event`) where you already handle messages/tools. One line for causal link: `parent_id=...`.

**Q: Latency impact?**
A: Logging is async HTTP; embedding generation is non-blocking on the hot path. Typical integration is fire-and-forget `await db.log(...)`.

**Q: What if OpenAI is down / we don’t use OpenAI?**
A: Logging and causal features work without embeddings. Semantic search and `context_for` need embeddings (today: OpenAI). Other embedding providers = roadmap; say “check with team” unless confirmed shipped.

**Q: PII / GDPR?**
A: You control what goes in `data` and `metadata`. `forget()` deletes by metadata filter. Self-host keeps data on your infra.

**Q: Can we use it in regulated environments?**
A: Self-host + your VPC is the usual answer. Managed cloud: discuss DPA, retention, and region with founders — don’t invent certifications.

**Q: PyPI package confusion?**
A: Install **`zizkadb-sdk`** (not the unrelated `agentdb` package on PyPI). Import: `from zizkadb import ZizkaDB`.

## 15. Integration snippets (copy for demos)

**Minimal Python (managed):**

```python
import asyncio
from zizkadb import ZizkaDB

async def main():
    db = ZizkaDB("zizkadb_live_xxxx")
    r = await db.log(agent="demo-bot", event="started", data={"env": "prod"})
    print(await db.why(r.event_id))

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Claude / OpenAI agents:** Log `user_message`, each `tool_call`, and `assistant_response` with `parent_id` chaining — see homepage examples at db.zizka.ai.

**curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://db.zizka.ai/v1/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer zizkadb_live_xxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent":"demo","event":"tool_call","data":{"tool":"search"}}'
```

## 16. What marketing should **not** claim (yet)

- “Real-time alerts” everywhere — baseline exists; **alerting product** may be partial/roadmap (homepage mentions “Alerts coming” for session 50 narrative).
- “Replaces your observability stack” — it complements APM/logs; different layer.
- “Detects hallucinations” — drift is **behavioral statistics**, not truth verification.
- “SOC2 / HIPAA certified” — unless explicitly launched.
- “Works offline” — needs API reachability (or self-host on localhost).

When unsure: **“Let me connect you to engineering”** or point to **docs + GitHub**.

---

## 17. Elevator pitches by persona

| Persona | Pitch |
|---------|-------|
| **Backend engineer** | “One `log()` per decision, `parent_id` for causality, `why()` when prod breaks.” |
| **AI/ML engineer** | “Semantic search + time travel + drift baselines without locking to LangChain.” |
| **Platform / infra** | “Self-host Postgres+Qdrant stack, AGPL, Docker in 60 seconds.” |
| **Cursor/Claude power user** | “Add MCP — your IDE gets memory, search, and why() with no SDK refactor.” |
| **CTO / head of AI** | “Operational DB for agents: audit trail, GDPR forget, fleet baselines — not another vector index.” |
